# Tech Resources for Academic Communities, including students, faculty, research and life-long learners

This repository lists content suitable for students/faculty to learn Azure and other Microsoft technologies.

## Structure of this repository

THis repository is designed to build a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) site that is hosted using GitHub Pages.

The content of this site lives in the [docs](./docs) folder. The main page is constructed from the [README.md](./docs/README.md) in that folder, and the side bar is made of the contents of the [content](./docs/content) folder.

## Building the docs

To build these docs, you will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. Once you have this installed, install VuePress:

```sh
npm install vuepress
```

To build the docs, use the [`deploy.sh`](./deploy.sh) script. This script will build the docs, then push them to the `gh-pages` branch of a given fork of this project. You pass the GitHub user/org name to the script. This way you can test the build offline, then push to the parent as part of an automated script.

```sh
deploy.sh <org>
```

> Do not push to the gh-pages branch manually, as this branch is completely rebuilt during the deploy, overwriting all history.

## Contributing

We ðŸ’–**love**ðŸ’– contributions. In fact, we want students, faculty, researchers and life-long learners to contribute to this repo, either by adding links to existing content, or building content. Please read the [contributing guide](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more.
