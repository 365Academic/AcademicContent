# AI and Machine Learning

Most of the labs in this folder have been deprecated and replaced by labs on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-jabenn), our hands on, self-guided learning platform:

* [Create Intelligent Bots with the Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-bots-with-the-azure-bot-service/?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-jabenn)
* [Create no-code predictive models with Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-no-code-predictive-models-azure-machine-learning/?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-jabenn)
* [Classify images with the Microsoft Custom Vision Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/classify-images-with-custom-vision-service/?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-jabenn)
* [Analyze the sentiment of reviews with Keras](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/analyze-review-sentiment-with-keras/?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-jabenn)
* [Add conversational intelligence to your apps by using Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-and-publish-a-luis-model/?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-jabenn)
* [Train and evaluate deep learning models](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/train-evaluate-deep-learn-models/?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-jabenn)

The remaining lab is:

* [Video Indexer](./Video%20Indexer) - Index a collection of videos and extract insights such as people in the videos, topics discussed in the videos, and video transcripts. Then deploy a Node.js app that makes video content searchable.
